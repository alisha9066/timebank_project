TimeBank Project
Backend:It is basically an Atm for the user which withdraws,transact or create transactions for them which are services based and doesn't use any type of money(any other currency).I also gave my code to AI to make it more better and include all other requirements needed for my project to run it succesfully.
Frontend:AI helped me with it as the prompt for its proper Interface and buttons requirement was given by me.
.venv file was taught by our AI sir in college recently that venv file in python projects are used:(For keeping our environment connected for other users when they use our file. It helps to setup same environment on any computer.)
Github:I gave access to AI to upload my files on github .With help of running commands in powershell given by AI to me.Also AI created comments in my code so the the next person using my code can understand the fun
Just this process took me 2 days for uploading my files.Now anyone can run these files on their pc with a working frontend and backend. I hope you find this interesting. As it took alot of time and efforts.
